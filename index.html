          <p>
            Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can
            observe from running different operations. That sounds abstract, but
            as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a
            variable named message.
          </p>

          <code>
            <div><span>// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'</span></div>
            <div><span>// on 'message' and then calling it</span></div>
            <div><span>message.toLowerCase();</span></div>
            <div><span>// Calling 'message'</span></div>
            <div><span>message();</span></div>
          </code>

          <p>
            If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a
            property called toLowerCase and then calls it. The second one tries
            to call message directly.
          </p>

          <p>
            But assuming we don’t know the value of message - and that’s pretty
            common - we can’t reliably say what results we’ll get from trying to
            run any of this code. The behavior of each operation depends
            entirely on what value we had in the first place.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Is message callable?</li>
            <li>Does it have a property called toLowerCase on it?</li>
            <li>If it does, is toLowerCase even callable?</li>
            <li>If both of these values are callable, what do they return?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our
            heads when we write JavaScript, and we have to hope we got all the
            details right.
          </p>

          <p>Let’s say message was defined in the following way.</p>

          <code>
            <div><span>const message = "Hello World!"; </span></div>
          </code>

          <p>
            As you can probably guess, if we try to run message.toLowerCase(),
            we’ll get the same string only in lower-case.
          </p>

          <p>
            What about that second line of code? If you’re familiar with
            JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an exception:
          </p>

          <code>
            <div><span>TypeError: message is not a function </span></div>
          </code>

          <p>It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.</p>

          <p>
            When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses
            what to do is by figuring out the type of the value - what sorts of
            behaviors and capabilities it has. That’s part of what that
            TypeError is alluding to - it’s saying that the string "Hello
            World!" cannot be called as a function.
          </p>

          <p>
            For some values, such as the primitives string and number, we can
            identify their type at runtime using the typeof operator. But for
            other things like functions, there’s no corresponding runtime
            mechanism to identify their types. For example, consider this
            function:
          </p>

          <code>
            <div><span>function fn(x) {</span></div>
            <div><span> return x.flip();</span></div>
            <div><span> }</span></div>
          </code>

          <p>
            We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work
            if given an object with a callable flip property, but JavaScript
            doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can check while
            the code is running. The only way in pure JavaScript to tell what fn
            does with a particular value is to call it and see what happens.
            This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict what the code will do
            before it runs, which means it’s harder to know what your code is
            going to do while you’re writing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seen in this way, a type is the concept of describing which values
            can be passed to fn and which will crash. JavaScript only truly
            provides dynamic typing - running the code to see what happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            The alternative is to use a static type system to make predictions
            about what the code is expected to do before it runs.
